# CV-as-a-dashboard

Tableau Viz/Dashboard

I was watching an interview with a Data Analyst online, who mentioned that she had produced her CV in the form of a dashboard, but she did not give any futher details about how she did this. Curiosity got the better of me so I began to search online but I couldn't see anything that anyone had produced along these lines. I started to think about what I would include if I were going to do this, and this is the result https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarah.stevens.brown/viz/CVAsADashboard/Dashboard1  

It was difficult to persuade Tableau to form a network diagram, and to make it filter pictures, but I learned a lot of new skills from producing this, and I'm very happy with how it has turned out.
